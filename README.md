# Software-Defined-Network
This Python project simulates a Software-Defined Networking (SDN) environment. It includes components like an SDN controller, event manager, external apps, and network elements such as servers, switches, links, and traffic managers. Key features include event handling, network optimization, traffic management, and app integration.

## Features

**1. SDN Controller:** Manages network events, optimizes the network, configures routing protocols, handles network faults, and updates controller status.

**2. Event Manager:** Adds and processes events, generates alerts, analyzes event patterns, prioritizes events, and generates reports.

**3. External Applications:** Manages a list of external applications, executes apps, updates app settings, monitors app performance, configures app integration, and installs/uninstalls apps.

**4. Network Components:** Includes classes for servers, switches, links, traffic managers, and network management functionalities.

**5. Server:** Monitors server performance, optimizes server performance, and handles server faults.

**6. Traffic Manager:** Manages network traffic, applies Quality of Service (QoS) measures, analyzes traffic, routes traffic, simulates traffic generation, monitors traffic, and displays traffic statistics.

### Dependencies
This project has no external dependencies and can be run using Python 3.x.
